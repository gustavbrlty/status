## the week of 03/30/25 :
- think of using NixOS for my personal computer and hnf's webserver and hnf's database.
- think of doing tchouva by wearing tzitzit (in rembrance for shabbat) (with trelet) and by being more serious on shabbat.

## the week of 03/23/25 :
- week ended with a perfect shabbat
- trunk struts replaced on my car
- hnf : switched from salvo.rs to xitca-web for two reasons : one, I didn't get answer to my HTTP/3 problem with salvo ; second, xitca-web is better ranked (in [techempower.com](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#hw=ph&test=composite&section=data-r23)) compared to salvo.rs, knowing that xitca-web doesn't use unsafe code (like salvo.rs btw) and supports HTTP/3, however the xitca-web's code coverage is unknown.
- answered to Jean-Philippe why I obey Paul.
