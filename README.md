## the week of 04/06/25 :
- seeing the [complexity of correctly using HTTP3](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/09/http3-practical-deployment-options-part3/#alt-svc), I've chosen to make it available **later**.

## the week of 03/30/25 :
- think of using NixOS for my personal computer and hnf's webserver and hnf's database.
- think of doing tchouva by wearing tzitzit (in rembrance for shabbat) (with trelet) and by being more serious on shabbat.
- hnf : switching back to salvo.rs for two reasons, 1. xitca-web actually uses unsafe codes through "unsafe_collection"; 2. xitca-web, unlike salvo.rs, has dependencies which could potentially lead to supply chain attacks which is dangerous if the dependencies have not been checked before use (and I don't have the time to check them at the moment).

## the week of 03/23/25 :
- week ended with a perfect (phone and computer off ; only eating, sleeping, reading (without writing) and praying) shabbat (for example here is a [a picture of the food](metada/3-23-25-week_perfect_shabbat.jpg))
- trunk struts replaced on my car
- hnf : switched from salvo.rs to xitca-web for two reasons : one, I didn't get answer to my HTTP/3 problem with salvo ; second, xitca-web is better ranked (in [techempower.com](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#hw=ph&test=composite&section=data-r23)) compared to salvo.rs, knowing that ~xitca-web doesn't use unsafe code~ (like salvo.rs btw) and supports HTTP/3, however the xitca-web's code coverage is unknown.
- answered why I obey Paul ([#1](metada/3-23-25-week_J.P_message_1.PNG), [#2](metada/3-23-25-week_J.P_message_2.PNG), [#3](metada/3-23-25-week_J.P_message_3.PNG), [#4](metada/3-23-25-week_J.P_message_4.PNG))
