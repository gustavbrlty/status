## the week of 03/30/25 :
- think of using NixOS for my personal computer and hnf's webserver and hnf's database.
- think of doing tchouva by wearing tzitzit (in rembrance for shabbat) (with trelet) and by being more serious on shabbat.

## the week of 03/23/25 :
- week ended with a perfect (phone and computer off ; only eating, sleeping, reading (without writing) and praying) shabbat (for example here is a [a picture of the food](metada/3-23-25-week_perfect_shabbat.jpg))
- trunk struts replaced on my car
- hnf : switched from salvo.rs to xitca-web for two reasons : one, I didn't get answer to my HTTP/3 problem with salvo ; second, xitca-web is better ranked (in [techempower.com](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#hw=ph&test=composite&section=data-r23)) compared to salvo.rs, knowing that xitca-web doesn't use unsafe code (like salvo.rs btw) and supports HTTP/3, however the xitca-web's code coverage is unknown.
- answered why I obey Paul ([#1](metada/3-23-25-week_J.P_message_1.PNG), [#2](metada/3-23-25-week_J.P_message_2.PNG), [#3](metada/3-23-25-week_J.P_message_3.PNG), [#4](metada/3-23-25-week_J.P_message_4.PNG))
